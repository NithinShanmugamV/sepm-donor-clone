<h1 align = "center">Find a Blood donor</h1>
This is a web-based application I created using react native and deployed into firebase - https://donor-c.firebaseapp.com/. This is a web application which I created as part of my colloquium project work.
<h2>About Project</h2>
1. Despite technological advances, today's blood bank systems work manually and there is a lack of adequate information about the donor.
2. The goal of this project is to create a web-based system that has the capacity to avoid intermediaries and make it easy for users to connect donors and beneficiaries.
